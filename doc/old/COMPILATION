  course the same principles could be used on any LaTeX document).

1.  How to Create a Printable PostScript from the .tex Source

This document describes how to created a PostScript document, from the
{tlhIngan Hol mu'ghom mach} LaTeX (*.tex) source(s), should you ever
face that problem.


1.1.  Requirements

The following programs are required for the below described procedure
(it may be possible to use other similar tools for some parts of the
task, but these are the ones I've used):

  o latex
    * (describe required LaTeX-packages here)
    *
  o dvi2ps
  o a2ps *or* psnup (which is part of package called ``psutils'')


1.2.  Procedure


1.2.1.  Compile the .tex source

Use LaTeX to produce a .dvi file.


1.2.2.  Convert .dvi to .ps

Use dvi2ps to create a .ps file from the .dvi.


1.2.3.  Re-sort Pages of PostScript File into Booklet



1.2.4.  Scale Page Contents to A6 format

Either using the ``a2ps'' command, like this:

  a2ps -4 -B --border=no INFILE.ps -o OUTFILE.ps

This approach has for some reason stopped working for me, since a2ps
nowadays truncate some of the text closest to the (physical) margins
of my pages (my theory is that the a2ps command has been secretly
updated here at Uppsala University by our evil superuser). But fear
not -- there is another solution -- the ``psnup'' command (included in
a package called ``PSUtils''). Type the following to solve the same
problem in another way:

  psnup -4 INFILE.ps OUTFILE.ps


1.2.5.  Print Booklet

Using ``lpr'' or whatever.
