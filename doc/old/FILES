How do I assemble the book?

You print both the cover and the main document on a printer which can
print on both sides of the paper. Then you cut the stack of paper in
half (this is easiest to do with a knife, since the papers have a
tendency to glide away from each other when you use scissors) and put
the two resulting stacks on top of each other. (Check the page
numbering, so that you get it right.) Cut the cover into two in the
same way, and put one of them on top of the main contents (again
carefully checking the page numbering to see if you got it right).

Now you should just have to staple in the middle of your pile of paper
with some a-bit-stronger-than-standard staples and fold it. And you're
done!

(If you wish to make you pocket dictionary more resistant to wear and
tear you might want to enhance the strength of the cover by applying
duct tape to the back of it, or by wrapping it up in transparent
plastic [or both] before you staple the book together.)


Why separate the cover and main files?

The reason for splitting the files into cover and main is twofold. (1)
This makes it possible to print the cover and the contents of the
dictionary on two different types of paper, so that one may use a
thicker and/or colored paper for the covers. (2) This makes it
possible to distribute the covers in two separate versions, one with a
broader margin towards the back, so that there is room to strengthen
it with duct tape. And one with a narrower margin closest to the back,
when there is no need for that.


Why the bizzare page numbering of the cover?

The cover documents prints on one sheet of paper, but consists of two
covers (since you cut it in half). Because of this the page numbering
is a bit weird. (Pages 1-2 are repeated twice, then pages 3-4 are
repeated twice.)


What's the idea behind the file hierarchy?

The idea here is to keep the main directory "pocketdict/" as clean
as possible, it will only contain four files in the final version,
and that is a Swedish and an English version of both the cover and
the main text of the book. When LaTeX is run, it's always from this
directory, so all .dvi, .aux, .log files etc will be written here,
and hence kept in one place (where they can be easily sweept away if
need arises).

The "pocketdict/includes/" directory contains all sub­document used
by the main documents. Those includes that are used by both the
Swedish and English version resides here. Those files that are
specific for the English version can be found in the directory
"pocketdict/includes/eng/" and those specific for the swedish
version resides in "pocketdict/includes/Swedish/" (these two
directories should, in the finished version, contain files with the
same file names, but with different translations of the text.

The final directory "pocketdict/doc/" should contain some plain text
files that are not necessary to build or compile the text, but that
contains information about it. This documentation will (probably)
only be available in English.
