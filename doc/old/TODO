The correct names of the values are:

  \tokliwords   *not* \engwords
  \toklidate    *not* \engcompiledate  # this is not used
  \fromkliwords *not* \kliwords
  \fromklidate  *not* \klicompiledate  # this is not used


Also, how should the \edition value be updated (should be done
automatically)?

The script should generate a "values.tex" files, which could easily be
included in the book.
