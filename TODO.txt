Important Stuff
===============

* LaTeX/Perl (dict2latex.plx, tlh-en.tex/en-tlh.tex): 

    o Rename \lukli{} -> \tlh_en{}, and \lueng -> \en_tlh{}. Maybe turn some of
      the often-left-empty arguments into optional arguments?

    o Rename \lemma{} -> \tilde{} (or something similar, indicating that it
      makes a tilde in text).

* Perl (booksort):

    o Does this script do anything meaningful with PostScript files outputted
      by modern day LaTeX?

    o Should it be fixed in some way? Or just replaced by some existing Linux
      tool and deleted?

* Perl (dict2latex.plx):

    o Rename script. (To "zdb2tex" maybe?)

    o "××" -> "×".

    o Code cleanup "use strict", "use warnings" etc.

    o Check DB syntax on reading. Are there any mandatory fields missing? Are
      there any syntax errors (e.g. ~...~ should be matched).

    o Some DB entries should result in more than one dictionary entries on the
      Klingon--English site (based on <>«» markers).

* Makefile

    o Generation of tlh-en.tex/en-tlh.tex on-the-fly.

* Perl: Convert all Perl scripts to be able to handle UTF8.

    o DONE: bookprint, bin/dict2lateox.plx

* Perl: Scripts for resorting output file into printable booklet. Incorporate
  in Makefile.

* Makefile: LaTeX -> DVI target should scan .tex files for dependencies, so
  that output file is rebuilt if *any* of the input components have changed.

* Perl: Add scripts for regenerating dictionary text from database. Incorporate
  in Makefile.

* LaTeX: Clean up and remove unused code.

* Perl: "use strict" and "use warnings" in all scripts.



Textual Correcions/Clarifications
=================================

* Copyright page: Add Creative Commons license to copyright page.

* Update edition number.

* Suffix Guide: VS9 {-bogh} -- May the head noun be marked by any NS5 suffix,
  apart from {-'e'}?

* All but dictionary text: Sync pocket dictionary text with online version in
  this copy.

* Hyphenation of Klingon phrases?


Cosmetic, Minor Stuff
=====================

* Prettyfy source code. Consistent identtation, removal of all TODO/FIXMEs etc.

* tex/*/include/values.tex: Have "TODO ditch these values" comment.

* Rewrite instructions on stress. Section should be briefer and easier to read
  at a glance. Maybe use examples with underlined syllables and simple rules?

* Comments should always be in English, even in Swedish/Klingon version of
  dictionary.


Someday/Maybe -- Wishlist
=========================

* LaTeX: Module for automatic hyphenation of Klingon?

* LaTeX: Proper typesetting/linebreaking of URLs. \usepackage{url} and
  \usepackage{hyperref} neither allow URLs to be set in italics.


Old TODOs from the LaTeX Source
===============================

* From "tex/sv/sv-main.tex" and "tex/en/en-main.tex"

    o Include a more complete suffix reference.
    o A Swedish Translation.
    o Use the `vmargin' package to set margins instead of my own ad hoc code.
    o General clean-up of code & removal of old, unused code.
    o Make the back cover prefix table listen to margin etc and adapt.
    o Add `Klingonska Akademien' logotype to the front cover.

* From "include/commands.tex"

    o Section headings should use the \section{} command, instead of
      home-brewed the \header{} command defined in "commands.tex". (How could
      the `\section' command be overridden to do what \seaction{} does now?)
