Klingon Pocket Dictionary
=========================

This directory contains the source code used to produce Klingonska Akademien's
pocket dictionary. It is officially titled {tlhIngan Hol mu'ghom mach} ("A
Small Klingon Dictionary"), but affectionately known as {paqHom} ("The Little
Book") among many of its users. This dictionary is also available on-line[1].


Edition
-------

This is the 7th edition of the {paqHom}, as produced in January 2002 by
Klingonska Akademien, in Uppsala, Sweden. Today, in May 2010, this is still the
latest edition of the printed dictionary (while the on-line version has been
kept a bit more up-to-date).

Klingonska Akademien is hoping to be able to release a new updated edition of
the {paqHom} before November 2010 (at which time a course in Klingon will be
held in Stockholm).

What you find here represent the very first step towards a new, 8th edition, of
the {paqHom} -- collecting the old source code, and getting it to compile
again.


Notes on Compiling
------------------

I built this on a Karmic Koala, after installing the following:

    % sudo apt-get install texlive-full

(Actually I found a guide on the web[3] to help me with this, since I last
played with LaTeX about six or seven years ago and was a little rusty.)

The Makefile is new, and should be pretty straightforward. To compile a PDF of
the English-Klingon/Klingon-English version of the dictionary, run:

    % make english

If you want it in Swedish, use:

    % make swedish

A lot of files are created during compilation, to clean up the unnecessary
files, use:

    % make clean

And if you want to remove and intermediary files, as well as any resulting PDF
and PostScript files, use:

    % make distclean
